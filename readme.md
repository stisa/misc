Misc projects started and put on hold

# nimwasm

experimenting with a binaryen-like wasm generator, in nim. This means we can also get the generation step to happen
in js generated by nim. There's also a tiny promises wrapper in there.

- [js](https://github.com/stisa/misc/blob/master/nimwasm/src/nimwasm/js/)
  - [promises](https://github.com/stisa/misc/blob/master/nimwasm/src/nimwasm/js/promises.nim) wraps js promises ( kinda like futures )
  - [webassembly](https://github.com/stisa/misc/blob/master/nimwasm/src/nimwasm/js/webassembly.nim) wraps WebAssembly Js api
- [wasm](https://github.com/stisa/misc/blob/master/nimwasm/src/nimwasm/wasm) bytecode generation
- [leb128](https://github.com/stisa/misc/blob/master/nimwasm/src/nimwasm/leb128.nim) variable length encoder
